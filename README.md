# NBME_score_clinical_patient_notes
The task of extracting and classifying clinical concepts expressed in freewriting physiciansâ€™ notes written during preliminary patient inquiry, was modeled as a Question-Answering problem, and trained on a domain specific pretrained BERT. Further clustering manipulation on the classification features was conducted by sentence embedding and HDBSCN.
